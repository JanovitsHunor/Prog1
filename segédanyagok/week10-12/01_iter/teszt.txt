In this thesis, a Smart City application is presented, called the Robocar World Championship. 
The application is in the research domain of smart cities and autonomous cars and can offer a platform to investigate theories and conduct new research ideas. 
The system itself consists of several components written in C++11 using shared memory segments and several external libraries, such as the Boost Graph Library. 
The output of the Real-Time Traffic Analyzer is an aggregated data that can be served as an input for the Robocar City Emulator. 
This component can simulate traffic in urban areas. The original version of the system was inspected and was proven to be wrong regarding its simulation algorithm. 
So, we developed an algorithm that can provide a stationary distribution of the cars in a given time period. The proposed algorithm is based on graph theory and a Markov model of probability theory. 
The solution uses OpenStreetMap as a geographical data source and an open dataset, called the Taxi Trajectory Prediction. Based on these data sources a graph and a transition matrix on it can be built. 
This matrix contains the transitions between adjacent nodes, i.e., a probability vector for each node. This probability vector shows the probability of transition to the adjacent node for each node. 
In this thesis, the method of the construction of such a matrix is given. In addition, it is shown that the proposed algorithm can simulate such traffic where the distribution of cars is stationary and this stationary distribution is unique for a given graph and transition probability matrix.
